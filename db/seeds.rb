# => in the shadow's gentle sway,
# dear john doe comes our way.
# a name reversed, yet still it flows,
# in moonlit paths where silence grows.
#
# through the night with stars so bright,
# eoD nhoJ, a guiding light.
# echoes whisper secrets told,
# as dreams in slumber softly fold.
#
# the night embraces with tender care,
# while journeys wend through twilight air.
# in realms where hidden wonders lie,
# eoD nhoJ, a name untied.
#
# so here's to you, in verse we say,
# may joy and peace upon you lay.
# your path through night and day shall gleam,
# as life unfurls its mystic dream.
